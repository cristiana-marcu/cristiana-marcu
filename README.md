### Hi there, IÂ´m Cristiana ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm a **full stack** developer and **software engineering student**. I love design, algorithms and *elegant* problem solving âœ¨

As a master's graduate **Architect** I tend to put special attention on details but I also need to have a big picture of the projects I'm working on. As an **Anthropology** student and researcher, I really empathize with the real humans that use my applications. And, as a tech nerd, I **love** to code ðŸš€

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on developing my own shell in C, at the best programming campus: **42Madrid**.
- ðŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Python with Angela's Yu 100daysOfCode course on Udemy. Also, I never stop learning C.
- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on **web development** and **research** projects that link my fields of interest.

- âš¡  Fun fact: I have a crush on books ðŸ“š
